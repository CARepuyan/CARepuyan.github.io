                    <p class="card-text">White sandy beaches and coves, a century old lighthouse, hidden waterfalls and lovely people, all in a scenic ragged terrain surrounded by howling wind and huge waves, that is Palaui Island.

                        With a land area of more than 3000 hectares, Palaui, an island made up of volcanic debris, is politically under the jurisdiction of the town of Sta. Ana. It is home to a fishing community, without electricity and commercial accommodation. Its main attraction aside from its beaches is the Farol de Cabo Engaño, an 18th century lighthouse built by the Spaniards that guides ships entering and leaving the coastal towns of Sta. Ana specially those vessels using Port Irene and San Vicente Port, and those traversing the Babuyan Channel and Philippine Sea.
                        Fall in love in a place built by wind and waves, and nurtured by time; discover the distinct charm of its scenic ragged terrain; sing with the howling sound of its gigantic waves. Discover, explore and experience Palaui Island. Palaui Island is famous for scuba diving, snorkeling and fishing.</p>
